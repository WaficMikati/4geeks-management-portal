## Instructions

### 1. Database

I use PostgreSQL and therefore can only provide instructions for that. Make sure you have it [installed](https://www.postgresql.org/download/) on your system.

1. Create a new database (you can choose any name you like, `management_portal` is my default). In your terminal, run:

```sql
psql postgres
CREATE DATABASE management_portal;
\q
```

2. Rename `backend/.env.example` to `backend/.env`, then edit the `DATABASE_URL` value to reflect your PostgreSQL configuration. replace the `****` with your actual PostgreSQL user password, and use the same port as PostgreSQL (5432 is default):

```
DATABASE_URL=postgresql://postgres:****@localhost:5432/management_portal
```

### 2. Backend

I highly suggest creating a new virtual environment before installing the dependencies (listed in `backend/requirements.text`). Skip line 2 of step 2 if you prefer to work globally.

1. #### Change the value of `SECRET_KEY` to a **Codeigniter Key** from [randomkeygen](https://randomkeygen.com/):

```
SECRET_KEY=<key from randomkeygen>
```

2. #### Create new `venv`:

```bash
cd backend
python -m venv venv
```

3. #### Activate the `venv`:

- #### Linux/Mac

```bash
source venv/bin/activate
```

- #### Windows

```
venv\Scripts\activate
```

4. #### Install dependencies:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

5. #### Create the database tables:

```bash
flask db upgrade
```

6. #### Seed the database to generate and add sample data

```bash
python seed_db.py
```

7. #### Finally, start the server:

```bash
python run.py
```

### 3. Frontend

1. #### Install dependencies with pnpm or npm (I use pnpm):

```bash
cd frontend
pnpm install OR npm install
```

2. #### Rename `frontend/.env.example` to `frontend/.env`, and make sure it has the same port set as `FLASK_PORT` in `backend/.env` (default 5000)

3. #### Start the dev server, then visit the link printed in the terminal:

```bash
pnpm run dev OR npm run dev
```

### You should now be up and running!

Feel free to message me with any bugs you find.

## Personal Note

This was a fun and extremely challenging project for me to tackle. It took me around 20 hours to complete, and I learned a lot about professional code and structure (not that I have achieved it ðŸ˜…). This was my first complete fullstack project, and I am proud of my result. I see the flaws and messiness still left in my code, and will clean it up and refine it over time and as my experience grows...

## Database

### 1. Tech Stack

I used PostreSQL as it's the one we studied in the bootcamp, and it's my first and only database so far.
