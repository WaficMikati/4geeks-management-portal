## Instructions

## Personal Note

This was a fun and extremely challenging project for me to tackle. It took me around 20 hours to complete, and I learned a lot about professional code and structure (not that I have achieved it ðŸ˜…). This was my first complete fullstack project, and I am proud of my result. I see the flaw and messiness still leftover in my code, and will clean it up and refine it over time and as my experience grows...
